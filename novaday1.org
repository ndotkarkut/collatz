	Today, I focused on studying the fundamentals of A-Frame on their website by reading about their syntax and documentation. I closely followed one of their presentations called “A-Frame School,” where I was able to open a program on “Glitch,” an internet workspace where you can code in A-Frame. Coding on this website, I was able to create objects, like spheres, boxes, and planes in the VR environment. This first day of A-Frame already opened my eyes to how games or applications are made on VR. Eventually, I hope to become very comfortable with A-Frame, so that I am able to make programs regularly, edit/troubleshoot existing programs, and ultimately be familiar with the programming/software aspect of the world of VR. By the end of the internship, I hope to be comfortable with both the VR hardware and software so this was a step in the right direction.
	My next step in achieving my goal in A-Frame is by watching tutorials on YouTube to see how experienced programmers go about writing their code in A-Frame. This would help me visualize how my programs should look, and it will show me how to properly organize my code when writing programs.
